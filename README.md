# Unit-4-Game

description of the problem: create a page that has pictures that are randomly assigned to values between 19 and 120 and randomly picks a target number and when a user clicks on an image that it increments their number with the value associated with the crystal

how you solved it/technical approach: got a random number to be attached to each of the crystals and then a random number to be the target number through math.random and then when the user clicked on an image that it would increment their personal score. if they surpassed the variable of the target score then that would increment the losses and print to the html, just the same if they won but incrementing the wins
